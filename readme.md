### what is this thing?
While waiting for the functionality to edit a template, this extension allows to save the state of the template creation screen in order to restore it later.

This is not really modifying a template, but it allows to recreate one from a given state.

### How to use this
1) Install the extension (see below)
2) Go to the character sheet creation page
3) click on the logo of the extension
4) click on save or load from one of the 5 slots
